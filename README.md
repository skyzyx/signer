The **Signer** class is designed for those who are signing data on behalf of a public-private keypair.

In principle, the "client party" has public key (i.e., `client_id`) and a matching private key (i.e., `client_secret`) that can be verified by both the signer and the client (but nobody else as we don't want to make forgeries possible).

The "signing party" has a simple identifier which acts as an additional piece of entropy in the algorithm, and can help differentiate between multiple signing parties if the client party does something like try to use the same public-private keypair independently of a signing party (as is common with GPG signing).

Based on a simplified version of the AWS Signature v4.


## Examples

```php
use Skyzyx\Signer\Signer;

$self_key = 'Skyzyx';
$client_id = 'k3qDQy0Tr56v1ceo';
$client_secret = 'O5j@pG@Jt%AzyiJTEfo!Â£LSz8yqSj)JX)S6FvW%58KjlS9bc%Fi7&&C4KSCT8hxd';

$signer = new Signer($self_key, $client_id, $client_secret, 'sha512');
$signature = $signer->sign([
    'ClientID' => $client_id,
    'Domain' => 'foo.com',
    'Path' => '/',
    'Expires' => 'Wed, 13 Jan 2021 22:23:01 GMT',
    'Secure' => null,
    'HttpOnly' => null,
]);

$signature = wordwrap($signature, 64, "\n", true);

```


## Installation

Using [Composer]:
```bash
composer require skyzyx/signer=~1.0
```

And include it in your scripts:

```php
require_once 'vendor/autoload.php';
```


## Testing

Firstly, run `composer install -o` to download and install the dependencies.

You can run the tests as follows:
```bash
./vendor/bin/phpunit
```


## API Reference

The API Reference is generated by a tool called [phpDocumentor 2.x](http://phpdoc.org). You should install it locally
on your system with:

```bash
cd /usr/local/bin &&
wget http://phpdoc.org/phpDocumentor.phar &&
chmod +x phpDocumentor.phar &&
mv phpDocumentor.phar phpdoc
```

Once it's installed, you can generate updated documentation by running the following command in the root of the
repository.
```bash
phpdoc
```

## Coding Standards

PSR-0/1/2 are a solid foundation, but are not an entire coding style by themselves. I have taken the time to document all of the nitpicky patterns and nuances of my personal coding style. It goes well-beyond brace placement and tabs vs. spaces to cover topics such as docblock annotations, ternary operations and which variation of English to use. It aims for thoroughness and pedanticism over hoping that we can all get along.
